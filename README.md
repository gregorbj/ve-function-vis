# ve-function-vis
This repository contains files which read VisionEval framework function documentation files and from the documentation creates javascript files which are used to display the functions and their calling relationships in a graph visualization. The create_functions_docs.R script creates and saves the javascript files. The index.html file reads in the javascript files and uses the vis javascript library to create the graph visualization. The index.html file also includes some explanatory text. You can click on a function and move its location in the display to make it easier to see the functions it calls. You can view an example using the following url: https://gregorbj.github.io/ve-function-vis/
